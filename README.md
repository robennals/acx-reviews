## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd acx-reviews/main

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## Content Population

The app currently has one sample review. To populate with real content:

### Option 1: Fetch from ACX Substack Posts (Easiest)

Scrape published reviews from ACX Substack:

```bash
npm run fetch-acx
```

This will fetch ~75 reviews from published ACX posts (winners and finalists from all contests).

**What it does:**
- Scrapes HTML from Substack URLs listed in `data/sources/acx-urls.json`
- Converts HTML to clean Markdown
- Extracts metadata (title, author, date, etc.)
- Saves as markdown files in `data/reviews/{contest}/`

**Configuration:**
Edit `data/sources/acx-urls.json` to add/remove URLs.

### Option 2: Fetch from Google Docs (Requires Setup)

Extract reviews from Google Docs (includes all contest entries, not just winners):

```bash
npm run fetch-gdocs
```

**Prerequisites:**
1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Google Docs API
3. Create service account credentials
4. Download credentials JSON to project root
5. Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable

**What it does:**
- Fetches content from Google Docs via API
- Parses composite documents (multiple reviews in one doc)
- Converts Google Docs structure to Markdown
- Extracts individual reviews from large compilation docs

**Configuration:**
Edit `data/sources/gdocs-urls.json` to configure which docs to fetch.

**Note:** Google Docs fetching is not fully implemented yet. The ACX scraper is ready to use immediately.

### Generate Index

After fetching content from either source, generate the master index:

```bash
npm run generate-index
```

This scans all markdown files and creates:
- `data/reviews-index.json` - Master index with all review metadata
- Updates `data/contests.json` - Contest metadata with review counts

### Fetch All (Combined Workflow)

```bash
npm run process-all
```

Runs all scripts in sequence: fetch-gdocs → fetch-acx → generate-index

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run fetch-acx` - Fetch reviews from ACX posts
- `npm run fetch-gdocs` - Fetch reviews from Google Docs
- `npm run generate-index` - Generate reviews index
- `npm run process-all` - Run all fetch and index scripts

### Adding New Reviews

1. Add review as markdown file in `data/reviews/{contest-id}/`
2. Include proper frontmatter (see existing reviews for format)
3. Run `npm run generate-index` to update the index
4. Review will appear in the app immediately

### Customization

**Typography**: Edit `tailwind.config.ts` to adjust prose styles
**Colors**: Modify CSS variables in `app/globals.css`
**Contest badges**: Update colors in `components/contest-badge.tsx`

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy
4. Subsequent pushes trigger automatic deployments

**Build settings:**
- Framework: Next.js
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `.next` (default)

### Static Export (Alternative)

The app is configured for static export and can be hosted on any static host:

```bash
npm run build
# Output will be in the 'out' directory
```

Note: The current config has `output: 'export'` disabled to allow dynamic features. Re-enable in `next.config.ts` for pure static hosting.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- ✅ Project setup and core architecture
- ✅ Reading progress tracking with localStorage
- ✅ Browse and filter reviews
- ✅ ACX Substack scraper
- ⏳ Google Docs extractor (needs API setup)
- ⏳ Content population (200-300 reviews)

### Phase 2 (Future)
- [ ] Tag system for topical filtering
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
