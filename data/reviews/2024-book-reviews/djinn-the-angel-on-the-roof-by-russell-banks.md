Echoes of Rebellion: A liberated “Djinn” in Colonial Africa

         Russell Banks’s “Djinn” narrates the tale of a young man who, as an employee of a multinational corporation, experiences a series of strange and challenging events in Katonga, Africa. The protagonist’s encounter with “Djinn”, an African native, serves as a catalyst for his questioning of societal norms and power dynamics in colonial Katonga. Initially aligned with colonial narratives, the protagonist undergoes a transformative shift in perspective following Djinn’s shooting. This raises a central question: Why does the protagonist choose to mirror Djinn’s erratic behavior? An analysis of the protagonist’s motivations reveals a complex interplay between personal agency and societal constraints. By examining the protagonist’s journey alongside Djinn’s, we can explore the nuanced dynamics of power and resistance in colonial society. The protagonist’s evolving attitude towards Djinn’s actions represents a broader affirmation of individual rights and freedom, as well as a critique of established power structures. The essay contends that the protagonist’s emulation of Djinn reflects not only a rejection of colonial norms but also a recognition of the inherent tensions between individual freedom and societal constraints. Through this lens, the protagonist’s journey becomes a reflection of broader themes of resistance and self-discovery, challenging readers to reconsider their own understandings of power and agency in colonial contexts.

         The protagonist’s initial role exposes him to the societal norms and power dynamics prevalent in colonial Katonga, showcasing his unconscious immersion in the hegemonic structures of multinational corporate affairs and colonial regulations. Prior to his awakening, under the regime of power’s discipline, his perspective aligns with these structures, suggesting a lack of awareness of the oppressive realities within the colonial context. As a business manager, the protagonist asserts, “I don’t apologize for these conditions, nor do I judge them. Simply, they were, for me, working conditions” (2), reflecting his conformity to societal norms and a dearth of critical introspection. His duty is to navigate the complex power dynamics and economic exploitation in Katonga, depicted as a “capitalist pawn on the African chessboard” (1). Although initially adopting a detached and value-free stance, the protagonist’s observations of “a defensiveness [among the Katongans] fueled by generations of colonial and post-colonial dependency, deracination, poverty” (4) suggest the potential for conflict and alienation resulting from exploitation, laying the groundwork for the social power struggles and conflicts experienced by Djinn. Interwoven amidst the main narrative, the detailed descriptions of procurement processes, machinery acquisitions, and worker training serve to illustrate the routine social obligations and workplace norms, starkly contrasting with the encounter with “Djinn” and the subsequent series of unusual and puzzling occurrences suffused with a religious aura.

         The protagonist’s initial interaction with Djinn highlights the clash between a suppressed alienated individual and the wild, untamed essence of life, challenging the constraints of order. Initially unsettling for the protagonist, this encounter forces him to undergo introspection and come to a deeper understanding of himself. Initially, the protagonist encounters Djinn, a naked madman, in a café, who is “muscular” and ragged but with an unusually excited expression, as if suddenly enlightened. (6) Encountering the madman leaves the protagonist suddenly feeling “alone and cut off” and “vulnerable” (6), no longer adept at socializing, engendering profound anxiety and confusion about himself and his surroundings. This is because he begins to perceive the familiar yet alienated world, once filled with societal norms, through a new lens, leading to a sense of estrangement from familiar surroundings. “You back this time to stay wit’ us, mistah?” (8) The madman’s question signifies an invitation, a call for freedom, making the protagonist feel a sense of belonging with Djinn, no different from anyone else.

         The protagonist gradually develops a deeper empathy for the symbolic representation of resistance and individual freedom implied by Djinn’s actions. When the protagonist witnesses Djinn climbing buildings in an almost otherworldly manner in the café, Djinn is targeted by plainclothes police officers who aim their guns at him and call him to come down, threatening, “You know the rules”(14). The police symbolize the incarnation of power and authority, maintaining social order and enforcing laws, emphasizing individual compliance with societal norms and authoritarian ideology. His “harsh, but utterly relaxed voice” (14) underscores his confidence in his power. As the embodiment of the violent machinery, that police possess power with impunity, capable of easily determining the fate of a colonial native. “I looked for Djinn’s reaction, hoping against hope that he would immediately descend” (14), reflects the protagonist’s mindset of wanting Djinn to obey orders, indicating his initial conformity to societal norms. At this point, he does not yet comprehend the deeper significance of Djinn’s actions. “He looked like a man to whom everything had at last been elucidated” (14), suggests that Djinn’s demeanor is deliberate, leaving readers to anticipate and speculate: is Djinn mentally ill, or does he possess profound wisdom?

         The protagonist undergoes a profound psychological shift in his perception of Djinn, evolving from initial shock to a deep understanding and sympathy, prompting him to confront the harsh realities of societal repression. Djinn emerges as a symbol of enlightenment, with his face “ lit by a knowledge or emotion or memory that was more powerful and clarifying than anything we here below had ever experienced.” (14) As the café patrons watch in astonishment, the protagonist is captivated by Djinn’s expression, feeling himself transformed “into a beloved subject” (14). The compassion and humor in Djinn’s eyes “could not help but make us feel truly beloved” and liberated, “most of us for the first time in our lives” (14). Despite initially feeling a mixture of fear and fascination, the protagonist eventually develops admiration and even awe towards Djinn. However, Djinn’s life is abruptly ended by the police. The protagonist “watched”, left “aghast, bewildered, astonished” (15) by the incident, gaining a new perspective on the oppressive realities of colonial society. As Djinn’s body is swiftly haphazardly removed and life returns to normal for the café patrons, the profound enlightenment brought by Djinn seems to dissipate into the rigid routine of everyday life, highlighting the transient nature of enlightenment in the face of societal norms and constraints.

         The protagonist’s dialogue with the bartender, Andrew, underscores his growing skepticism towards prevailing norms. Prompted by Djinn’s unjust killing, the protagonist expresses disbelief, questioning the morality of the act with statements like “that hardly deserves shooting” (17). His shock deepens upon realizing the apathy of those around him towards Djinn’s fate, as he observes that “no one had objected or even seemed to care when he was shot and killed” (17). When he queries Andrew about the rationale behind Djinn’s killing with “Killed for what?” (17), Andrew’s response epitomizes blind adherence to authority: “It’s the rules that matter, and he broke them” (17). “But he’s a madman! That could have been you! Or me! Any one of us could be mad. Maybe we are mad, and he’s the sane one. Who can say for sure?” (17) The protagonist’s subsequent assertion signifies his increasing defiance towards arbitrary power, recognizing that Djinn, a victim of arbitrary execution, could easily have been any oppressed individual. When encountering Djinn in the café, the protagonist regards him as “just another madman”, an epitome of those who “suffered from the horrors of the 1960s revolution and the civil war” (6). But “such a figure was not an unusual sight” (6). He recognizes Djinn’s plight as casualty of colonial oppression and conflict, rather than insanity. Djinn reflects the collective suffering of Africans who have endured years of hardship, loss, and poverty as a result of colonialism and its aftermath (7). In his death, Djinn represents the marginalized and excluded groups in colonial society who seek to assert their existence and dignity through acts of resistance and defiance.

         The protagonist, awakened by the mysterious and powerful aura of Djinn, risking his life for freedom, eventually challenges the prevailing power dynamics and confronts systemic injustice. When Djinn asked, “You back this time to stay wit’ us, mistah?” (8), his once wild greetings now serve as an invitation to rebel against oppressive power structures. “Those feelings I would eventually be forced to act upon, for they had already begun to act deeply upon me,” (18) expressing a desire to break free from constraints. He heads “directly to the place where Dinn had started his fatal climb the night before” (18), echoing Djinn’s focused determination, “seemed on a mission, focused and directed” (8), arriving at a position not far from the roof. “Come down, Djinn, or I’ll shoot.” (20) The repeated address of “Djinn” signifies the police’s indiscriminate disregard for the lives of the oppressed, also hinting at the protagonist’s affirmation of Djinn’s protest. The protagonist keenly senses the threatening implications of danger, as the casual and indifferent imperative contains the harshness of power. He understands “if he could kill me, he would.” (20) Therefore, he “made one final lunge to safety, over the edge entirely and onto the sloped roof, out of the shooter’s line of sight” (20), facing the violent barrel with a fearless attitude. Djinn’s death reflects the limitations of marginalized groups in society. Out of refusal to accept injustice, the protagonist resists to remain suspended in mid-air during the confrontation with the police; he must succeed. Or he risks becoming another victim of arbitrary killing. Ultimately, he successfully climbs onto the roof, sitting there alone, gazing at the stars, experiencing a profound sense of detachment.

          Russell Banks’s “Djinn” delves deep into the themes of freedom and resistance in the face of oppressive power structures. The protagonist’s journey symbolizes a significant shift from compliance to defiance, reflecting a profound awakening to the harsh realities of colonialism. “A great thing had been inflicted upon me.” (20) This declaration epitomizes the protagonist’s newfound liberation from societal constraints, emphasizing the meaning of reclaiming freedom and dignity.  Russell Banks’ narrative highlights glimpse the greatness of individual strength and inspires readers to actively challenge the constraints and uphold freedom and dignity in pursuit of a more just and humane society.
