### Introduction

When Scott announced a book review

Contest, I wondered what to do.

I pondered for a month or two,

I wanted to try something new,

But couldn't think of what.

At first I dismissed poetry,

But with this one I have history,

Well-known romantic tragedy:

The Lady of Shalott.

### About the poem

Composed in 1832,

Then ten years on rewritten anew,

I chose the second to review[[49]](#ftnt49)

(The version I already knew)

With a verse count of nineteen.

And as for lines, it's nine per verse

Of iambic tetrameter.

Not couplets; Tennyson preferred

This complex rhyming scheme.

The author is Lord Tennyson

Who tells a tale Arthurian:

A mysterious lady lives alone

Within sight of King Arthur's throne

On the island of Shalott.

And there she weaves a tapestry

Made up of images she sees

In her mirror, various scenes

Of the road to Camelot.

The mirror, of course, reflects the view

From the window in the room.

But she must never leave her loom

Or turn to look directly through

Down to Camelot.

The lady does not know her fate,

She only knows her doom awaits

So, watching shadows, still she stays

Alone upon Shalott.

Until one day it goes awry,

A dashing knight comes riding by.

The pale reflection won't suffice;

She turns to see with her own eyes

The bold Sir Lancelot.

The curse has come, her life is o'er,

She leaves her lonely island bower

And floats downriver to the shore

Of the court at Camelot.

The story had been told before,

It's part of the Arthurian lore.

Mort Artu a likely source;

And Malory wrote her too, of course

- Elaine of Astolat.

And Tennyson's inspiration

A novellina - Italian -

A very short story with the name

La Damigella di Scalot.

The common end of all of these

The tragic death of the lady

From loving unrequitedly,

Her body borne towards the sea

Run aground at Camelot.

Then to the basics of the tale,

Lord Tennyson adds his own detail -

The curse, the mirror, and the veil

For his Lady of Shalott.

### Themes

And so this leads me on to themes,

Of courtly love, romantic dreams.

A common reading is to see

Victorian femininity,

Chaste innocence in death.

But other scholars make the point

The Lady gets to make her choice,

And in her death she finds her voice;

A form of empowerment.

But as for me, when reading round,

The interesting point, I found

To be the absence of background

In contrast to the other accounts -

The Lady stands alone.

I mean, Elaine has history

In the account by Malory.

She's grounded in reality,

She has family and home.

Tennyson's Lady lacks all that.

She has no family, name, or past,

Her tale's distilled to the central act,

Her one decision, its impact,

The inevitable lament.

And Lancelot is not to blame

For riding by her windowpane.

He has no active role to play,

Just final acknowledgement.

So I think Tennyson's purpose here

To emphasise the great ideal.

Romantic, courtly love so pure -

No interaction needed here -

Just one look from above.

The curse, the mirror, the tapestry,

The elements of fantasy,

Are there to corral the doomed lady

To the heights of courtly love.

### Cultural impact

As for culture, it belongs

Within the great Arthurian throng

Born of the Mabinogion[[50]](#ftnt50),

A fandom that goes on and on,

Entranced by Camelot.

In fact the poem's main borrowing

From the Arthurian setting -

The courtly lover man supreme,

Bold Sir Lancelot.

At the time, the artists flocked

To paint the Lady of Shalott.

At her weaving, in her boat,

Gazed upon by Lancelot,

Ensnared in threads of fate.

Though Tennyson made quite a fuss

About the scenes which were made up

(which frankly is ridiculous.

Pots and kettles, mate!)[[51]](#ftnt51).

And since then the poem's shaped

Many more artistic takes,

Inspired by the lonely maid

And by her doomed romantic fate;

Books, music and TV.

From title quotes to entire plot,

The poem has supplied the lot,

Cultural imagination caught

By Shalott's mystery.

And it has resonance today

If in an unexpected way.

Not for the romantic fate,

But for the Lady's lonely wait -

Which now we all have known.

We too have huddled in our towers,

And watched the world through glass for hours,

Half-sick of shadows in the sour

Isolation of our homes.

### Conclusions

Turning to my own history,

Way back when I was just fourteen

My English teacher, Miss McGee[[52]](#ftnt52),

Had made a bet with Upper Three

To learn the thing by rote.

A fiver was a lot back then;

I memorised it all, but when

I told her, she refused my claim -

Wouldn't pay a jot.

To be scrupulously fair,

I was in another year,

But she taught us too. I fear

I sulked in every class of hers

And wouldn't let it drop.

And this went on for weeks until

She gave in and paid the bill.

And I have a soft spot still

For the Lady of Shalott.

So in conclusion, please do

Read Tennyson's poem too.

It's one verse more than this review

And the rhymes work better too

(He was Poet Laureate!).

My mind is now embalmed in rhyme,

I think in meter all the time,

So here I'll draw my final line

'neath the Lady of Shalott.
