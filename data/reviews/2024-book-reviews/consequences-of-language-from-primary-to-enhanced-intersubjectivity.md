It was one of those books. You know the type: the essential difference between humans and chimps is tools, is language, is forebrains. These books are usually bad, because it always turns out that another species, typically bees, can do the same thing. Worse, this book was claiming that the essential difference is intersubjectivity, the preferred haunt of polarized ideologues and depraved French philosophers. Why did I read it? I have nothing to say in my defense. Maybe I was bored.

Much to my surprise, Consequences of Language changed my view of a social theory I had long dismissed as obscurantist bullshit, triggering a binge of going back to read books I'd previously sneered at. Many of them were terrible. Imagine a spectrum of the openness personality trait, with curmudgeons at one end and galaxy-brains at the other. Fringe theories, even if they later become mainstream dogma, attract galaxy-brains who propound the view mixed with false or unfalsifiable nonsense, never clearly state a thesis and follow their stream of consciousness for hundreds of pages and dozens of books. This repels the curmudgeons, who reject the theory at the mere sight of such toxic stylistic sludge, even if it's true. In Consequences, Nick Enfield and Jack Sidnell propose a fringe theory, but write as if their take has good evidence and should be accepted by all reasonable people. They use introduction and conclusion paragraphs like normal people. They defend a falsifiable thesis stated at the beginning of the book. They stay on topic and make their point in a single volume. Their unexceptional academic writing works as a bridge, allowing reasonable people who expect evidence to investigate intersubjectivity without puking.

Let's dig in.

## Definitions and Preliminaries

You live in Belarus in 1980. You are skeptical of communist ideology and know the Party is corrupt. Should you try to organize a revolt? Seemingly everyone else still believes, so you avoid politics and stay quiet.

You live in Belarus in 1985. In hushed conversations, your friends and family privately complain of Party corruption. Seemingly everyone knows that communist ideology is fake. Should you try to organize a revolt? You don't know if your friends know that everyone knows. If they think that you two are only ones who know, they might turn you in if you try to organize. You keep bitching about politics, but discreetly.

You live in Belarus in 1989. You saw Gorbachev on TV, talking about glasnost. Even Gorbachev knows communist ideology is fake! And everyone saw him on TV, so everybody knows that everybody knows. You met one guy who still believes, but everybody else just laughed at him, which was safe because you all knew he was the only one. Should you organize a revolt? You don't need to, the revolt organizes itself, and the occupation government dissipates like a bad dream.

This fictional interlude illustrates how intersubjectivity is typically defined: as common knowledge. In order to coordinate action, it is not enough that each participant privately knows what to do, but you must have confirmation that others are on the same page. Consequences makes a frame-by-frame analysis of how common knowledge arises, down to the level of small pauses in conversation. This approach replaces fuzzy concepts of “identity”, “institutions” and so on with ensembles of well-defined, seemingly mechanical components, like taking apart a clock and discovering that “time” is made of gears. I will follow the book as it proceeds in the opposite direction, starting from tiny components and arriving at actionable common knowledge. Consequences begins by defining “intersubjectivity = activity + accountability” and demonstrating the operations of activity and accountability in some detail.

## Activity and Accountability

Consequences illustrates activity and accountability with an ethnographic observation, of two monks working a two-man saw.

Each monk unconsciously expects the other to pull the saw as soon as the first has finished his turn pulling. Consciously, they may be thinking about anything at all, perhaps what is for lunch, (no wait, I'm sure they're in profound meditation!) but should the second monk slack off and forgo his turn pulling, then the first will probably be surprised and upset and demand an explanation. By beginning the sawing task together, the monks have implicitly committed themselves to certain expectations: to pull when it's your turn, to free the saw when it gets stuck and so on. By ordaining as monks, they have taken on more explicit and durable commitments: to always wear the monks’ robes, to only eat between dawn and noon, and numerous other religious rules governing monastic life. These broader commitments are scaled up versions of the transient commitments the monks take on when they saw, and violations attract rebuke in much the same way. Joking about lax monks who eat after noon, the locals '''say that after midday, monks “don’t eat rice” (the Lao idiom meaning “having a meal”), then they laugh and joke that monks might have fruit or noodles instead.’’’

It might be worth mentioning at this point that the authors are linguistic anthropologists who travel the world recording everyday conversations, and later analyze the recordings for linguistic insights. They have no fetish for noble savages, and their sites include unromantic locations such as America and Russia.

They observed Laotian villagers weaving reed mats, which is harder than it looks. When the weaving got derailed, the villagers spoke to each other to get it back on track, clarifying exactly what needed to be done, how, which was the right color of reed, and so on. This is another illustration of how people had expectations of each other in the service of a shared goal, and worked to repair their interaction when it broke down.

Generalizing these examples highlights characteristics of social norms: expected behavior passes without comment, while unexpected behavior is called out, and observers try to infer and pass judgment on the reason for violating the norm. The mat-weaving husband indicated he couldn't tie off the reed properly because he had no weaving experience, and his wife's chidings were only half-serious. Contrastingly, the joke about the monks eating after noon has a bit of acidity. Presumably the villagers inferred the snacking monks were negligent, and passed judgment on their character.

Providing reasons has a social function on its own, regardless of the reasons given. '''Langer, Blank, and Chanowitz (1978) conducted an experiment in which people who were busy using a photocopy machine were approached by someone asking to cut in and copy five pages. When no reason was given, people complied around two thirds of the time. But when a reason was given, they complied more than 90 percent of the time. Crucially, this high rate of compliance occurred both for “real” reasons (e.g., “because I’m in a rush”) and for empty reasons, which added no content at all to the original request to make copies (i.e., “because I have to make copies”).’’’[0] Rationalists take note: an attempt at persuasion can be rational in the sense that it works towards implicit social goals, while the reasons given might be wrong or vacuous. One shouldn't call another irrational based on unverified assumptions about their goal, because democracy is great! America!

Not only can reasons be effective when vacuous, language offers a specific vocabulary for such persuasion: “‘what Bernard Williams … calls “thick ethical concepts”: highly salient terms that combine a descriptive and an evaluative component. Much of the philosophy of ethics has, according to Williams, adopted a largely reductive approach to such concepts, attempting to isolate the “is” from the “ought.” Importantly for our purposes, Williams argues that such concepts often provide “someone with a reason for action,” and that though their “application is guided by the world” in the sense that they can be used “rightly or wrongly,” they are at the same time “action-guiding.” … In other words, these are the concepts in terms of which people think and talk about what they do, and that they use in accounting for their own and other people’s behavior.’” The corollary of successful persuasion using thick concepts is that people's actions, probably including yours, are guided by concepts which only obliquely refer to the physical world. How many have dedicated their lives to democracy, communism, truth, freedom, love, equality, God, Allah… It is quite common to have long armchair discussions seeking to define such terms: “What is love?” Understanding intersubjectivity allows us to instead ask answerable questions: What acts can a particular thick concept justify? Who can invoke a particular thick concept, when persuading whom? It is common to view thick concepts as quite abstract, but this derives from the false assumption that they primarily describe the world. Instead, thick ethical concepts motivate action.  Realizing that God is a thick ethical concept gives the corollary: metaphysics is intersubjectivity misunderstood.

Speaking of rationality, notice that the Laotian monks are not complying with the standard game-theoretic account of cooperation, which claims that you or your kin will receive reward or punishment for cooperating or not. In this case, the villagers merely keep track of which monks are diligent or lazy. There is no physical reward or punishment, except (the monks believe) maybe in the next life.

Norms can recursively regulate other norms. For instance, we can imagine the husband puts in a red reed, and his wife tells him to put in a red reed, he might say indignantly “That's what I did! Why are you correcting me?” There is a meta-norm, which prohibits commenting on correct behavior.

Having sketched the basic principles of intersubjectivity, we have a fuzzy outline of how language and intersubjectivity co-constitute: the rules of language are social norms, while violated social norms are repaired using language.

## Roles

I'm a man. Just kidding, now I'm a woman. Actually, I changed my mind; I'm plural and use “they” pronouns; one of me is indigenous and another is Lantinx.

The authors wisely avoid direct discussion of identity politics, however they explain social roles[1], a theory often cited in contemporary optics-driven politics. They consistently choose benign examples, leaving extrapolation to controversies as an exercise for adventurous readers. Even their sedated discussion still allows us to infer explanations for the ideological roots of identity politics, and to explain why optics-driven politics is on the rise.

A role is a bundle of rights and duties. Some roles are implicit and transient: the person whose turn it is to talk in a conversation only holds this role for a few seconds. Others are explicit and durable, such as citizenship. Rights are actions you can take without expecting surprise or sanction, duties are actions you expect surprise and sanctions for not taking. For example, the current speaker faces dinosaurs ruled the earth from 100 million to 10 million years ago surprise and sanction for incoherence or wandering off topic. Norms regard roles: a mother is expected to feed her child, but the duty disappears if she puts the child up for adoption.

Ancient Buddhists debated the storage medium of the good and bad deeds that determined where you would be reincarnated, and eventually concluded that it was tracked in the Akashic records, a sort of ethereal database for sin. The authors seem skeptical of this possibility, in fact they do not discuss it, even in jest, and insist that roles must be constantly enacted. If you met a police officer out of uniform, you wouldn't let them arrest you, since you wouldn't recognize them as police. If the person who is talking stops, they lose their role as speaker. Roles are implied by a person's appearance and behavior, and we constantly infer our own roles and those of others from physical actions and attributes. You might think that your ID card is a durable medium which encodes your role as citizen, but think again: you must be able to display your ID at any time. If you tell the immigration officers that you have an ID but prefer not to show it, they won't believe you and, in practice, your citizenship will stop.

Roles are not necessarily epistemically sound categories in relation to the physical world, but they are socially predictive: a police officer will most likely investigate if I report a crime to them, even though there is no bodily difference between police and ordinary citizens.

This point will bother ACX readers, so I'll emphasize it much more than Consequences. Consider the Ethereum blockchain, which is surely unrelated to the Akashic records. The information stored on-chain has no physical counterpart. It is not backed by gold reserves somewhere. Yet it can have physical effects. I can sell my Eth and get USD and then go buy eggs. Ethereum users are rational, assuming that their goal is to store value. If you assume that their goal is to accurately describe the physical world, then they look pretty stupid and irrational. I just think that's a bad assumption.

If my Ethereum node miscalculates how much Eth is in someone's account, other nodes will (in their own records) confiscate my deposit. This penalty may never be materialized into a lack of physical goods and services, and yet that is enough enforcement to keep Ethereum in working order. This parallels the way that misbehaving Laotian monks are never physically punished; it is sufficient that their misdeeds be publicly tracked.

Ethereum is not only a currency, though. It can track arbitrary data and perform computations on them. We can imagine a token (a minor currency defined inside of Ethereum) which is designed to maintain a fixed USD exchange rate, buying or selling Eth to maintain its peg. If the token's contract (a program inside Ethereum which registers who owns how much of the token) knows the current exchange rate, then Ethereum can reliably transact according to spec. The difficulty, though, is ensuring that the exchange rate is right, since this comes from outside Ethereum. The token managers could lie or make a mistake, at which point the blockchain would be storing a wrong exchange rate.

The computers responsible for backing up the data would perpetuate this hypothetical error, even though they could check and find the correct rate. If they correct it, their peers will simply notice a discrepancy, and confiscate the deposit of the earnest do-gooder. The peers are rationally following their incentives: their goal is not to accurately describe the physical world, so they rationally repeat falsehoods. They aren't consciously lying[2]: they never checked the real rate, because they don't care, because they aren't incentivized to care.

Some roles filled by humans entail claims about the physical world. No! Don't say that role! Then we'll get into politics. Let's take a benign example instead. Minors can't buy alcohol, and being a minor is officially defined by your physical age. However, the system of social consensus cannot directly measure your age, much the same way that Ethereum cannot directly measure the exchange rate. It has to rely on someone to formalize your age, perhaps by a state issued ID card. The ID card could be wrong, “borrowed”, etc. The system of social consensus, then, is faced with unique epistemic challenges that embodied individuals don't face, and can easily get stuck propagating information that is internally consistent and externally inconsistent.

What's real? That depends on how you define words. Instead, let's ask: which external inconsistencies make your actions ineffective? If the system of social consensus gets stuck propagating a useless pandemic response, a million people could die. If a seventeen-year-old drinks a beer, it'll probably be fine.

Further, external inconsistencies can create material advantages. Suppose I didn't commit a crime, and the police arrest me. If I think the court system is fair, then I'll let them arrest me and plead my innocence in court. Without this system, I would obviously try to run, hide or resist, bringing the conflict into the physical realm and endangering everyone. Having unmistakably uniformed police with certain rights and duties is physically beneficial, even though the police role is vacuous (purely social), not referring to biological characteristics of the police officers. Much the same coordination benefit accrues from arbitrating who is the current speaker in a conversation without reference to any physical traits of the conversants. A truly rational person, then, would be willing to make vacuous assertions.

Things get truly strange in the orbit of thick ethical concepts, but even here people are reasonably pursuing social goals. Thick ethical concepts can motivate patterns of justification. For instance, if Adam supports a claim with a Bible quote, Barb can disagree by quoting a different passage, but if she questions the legitimacy of the Bible as an authority on ethics, Adam may respond by demeaning her public image and moral worth. Thick ethical concepts can also motivate and justify patterns of behavior, such as attending mass. The behaviors and justifications are typically not aligned with each other: why couldn't you just confess once on your deathbed and skip weekly mass? If God loves us, why can't he just automatically forgive us? etc etc. Outsiders observe some quite strange behavior: people repeating the prescribed actions over and over without getting any closer to their stated goal. Thick ethical concepts are like a heavy planet in general relativity, distorting the intersubjective field all around and sucking people into orbit, into pointless, repetitive behavior: Consumers keep buying but are never satisfied. Bankers keep earning, long past when they have enough savings for multiple lifetimes. The devoted keep worshiping, even when no one remembers the founder's values. Political movements keep fighting, even after the enemy is vanquished. (Or maybe it's not like orbiting heavenly bodies, but more like endless reincarnation in earthly bodies.)  This is all perfectly rational towards the goal of optimizing individual reputation, and the justifications offered likely fulfill that culture's norms for public reasoning, and so if you ask them to apply a formal reasoning system, they'll end up right back where they started.

I've said that orbiting thick ethical concepts is “rational towards the goal of optimizing individual reputation”, but also “quite strange” and orthogonal to pursuing their stated goal. You might try to counterargue that this is just mincing words, and is just a fight over how to define “rational.” The two views recommend vastly different actions, though. If you believe that people are well-intentioned but error-prone, then they will come around to your way of doing things if you clearly explain it. If you believe that people are smart and do what's incentivized, then you change minds by changing incentives. This goes just as much for you as for others: if you want to change your own mind, you should plug into different institutions. Far from thick ethical concepts, people nimbly pursue their stated goals and can quickly adopt whatever ideas and technology helps. We need a different mode of operation in the orbit of thick ethical concepts, where people apply bespoke reasoning rules and don't act towards their stated goals.

A materialist, trying to escape the distortions near thick ethical concepts and other external inconsistencies of the system of social consensus, may resort to performing their social roles ironically, claiming that all society is mere pretense. The aspects of themselves that ring true are necessarily private, because if displayed they would (allegedly) become superficial. This position is internally consistent and extremely popular. It's terrible, though. Such defeated materialists are false to themselves, having given up trying to embody any principle they truly believe in. It leaves the commons a desert, void of anything credible or worthwhile. For your sake and all of ours, take a risk and publicly display what you really believe in.

Understanding intersubjective roles forces us to choose, exclusively, between two definitions of truth: prediction and control vs material correspondence [2.5]. If you manage to take turns in conversation, you have chosen to use social roles for prediction and control. Some of those roles entail false or vacuous claims about the physical world. Don't let that hollow you out: truth-seek until you find a duty you would perform even if everyone thought you were crazy, and then do it publicly. That duty constitutes a grounding role, contextualizing any transient roles you adopt for purely social reasons. There will always be tradeoffs between social utility and material consistency. This way you can make them knowing which way is up.

## Participation

I was vacillating between different framings for this next chapter, when my colleague's brother died. As our carpool arrived to the funeral, my first impression was thumping EDM. The brother's wife cried silently for a couple minutes, otherwise no one seemed upset. His son was excited to meet a westerner and practice his English, seeming not to be bothered at all. During the ceremony we sipped soda and made small talk, not making any effort to look sad or even particularly attentive.

Different cultures have very different protocols for participating in social engagement. From inside, our birth culture seems normal, necessary and natural. Comparing participation norms across cultures reveals them as arbitrary, complex, unconscious, and pervasive. The highly emotive grieving required to participate in western funerals can have a huge impact on the lives of the bereaved; participation norms are not some unimportant tiny gear hidden deep in the social clockwork. Westerners cannot just choose to feel less grief[3], even if they know intellectually that their emotions are culturally set. Realizing the pervasiveness of participation norms reveals the limitations of self-awareness and self-control. Good morning fish, this is water.

The authors approach participation by first reviewing the analysis of American culture by Erving Goffman, whose “analysis is exceedingly rich and nuanced and his eye for interactional strategy unrivaled.” Goffman argues that Americans count you as participating when you pay attention to the topic of conversation. Any other object of attention will alienate you from the conversation, including: “‘

1.  External preoccupation: “The individual may neglect the prescribed focus of attention and give his main concern to something that is unconnected with what is being talked about” …
2.  Self-consciousness: “At the cost of his involvement in the prescribed focus of attention, the individual may focus his attention more than he ought upon himself— himself as someone who is faring well or badly, as someone calling forth a desirable or undesirable response from others.” …
3.  Interactional consciousness: “A participant in talk may become consciously concerned to an improper degree with the way in which the interaction, qua interaction, is proceeding, instead of becoming spontaneously involved in the official topic of conversation.” ...
4.  Other-consciousness: “During interaction, the individual may become distracted by another participant as an object of attention.”

”’ Notice that, by definition, you cannot consciously choose to fulfill the American (western? developed?) role, because that approach would make you too self-conscious to succeed in participating.

I have consistently chosen mechanical metaphors for the social system, such as clocks and Ethereum. Goffman, though, described Americans as alienated when they did not fulfill the participant role. This role, then, is no neutral technical construct. Not being in it subjectively feels like something. In this case, something shitty. The social system matters not only for its outcomes, but its internal process is felt by the nodes, who are not software but breathing psychological subjects. When other people talk about you because you violated a norm, your misdeed is accounted in the ethereal ledger, but you also feel shame. Nearly every data operation discussed by Consequences subjectively feels like something to the participants. The authors rarely mention this aspect of intersubjectivity, but I want to emphasize it because it is one of the best reasons for non-linguists to care about the details of intersubjectivity.

Back to alienated Americans. Goffman illustrates his thesis with observations from a backyard barbeque.

 “‘The men have been telling dirty jokes…Curt, who is Carney’s cousin, is telling a joke to Gary, which he presents as a true story, about the time that he and Mike were captured by the enemy in Vietnam. … At this point, Carney turns to her cousin Curt and says, “You forget I’m here.” By saying this, Carney is suggesting that she can disconfirm what Curt is saying. Indeed, Curt, who has persevered in the face of multiple challenges by Gary, here appears to acquiesce to Carney. Not only does he suspend the telling in progress, saying “Alright,” he joins with Carney in a bout of laughter. In this way, Curt displays that he has been “caught out” by Carney and does not in fact proceed with the telling until Carney instructs him with, “Go on.” Notice, then, that in formulating this in the way she does, Carney characterizes her own participation as something that has been treated by others as equivocal, ambiguous, or peripheral— as someone who, though present, can be, and has been to this point, disattended and, in fact, forgotten. A closer study of this episode (Sidnell 2011) argues that this equivocality is carefully managed by the participants, and especially by Carney, in such a way as to avert potential recipient design problems implicated in the telling of dirty jokes (again illustrating the normative nature of contact).’”

The authors do not claim that Carney consciously thinks to herself about “recipient design problems” in those terms, but rather that she can, unconsciously, keep track of how others are likely to view her, and can formulate a strategy to optimize this. Such social strategizing occurs even in situations which are apparently casual and cooperative.

“‘To take another example from the same occasion, Curt, Mike, and Gary are talking about local car races. … The women do not actively participate in the discussions about the races and the men make no effort to include them. Phyllis, who is Mike’s wife, says, apparently to no one in particular, “Need more ice,” picking up her glass and an empty bottle of Coke as she stands up and walks away from the table. Why does she make this unilateral assertion, with no obvious connection to the interaction taking place? Goodwin (1986) analyzes the utterance as an account for Phyllis’s action, a way to block any inference that, by departing from the table, she is reacting to what has been said or perhaps to the fact that she has not been included in the conversation.”’

This may be the most analyzed barbeque in history; at least four linguists have written about it. Like Carney, Phyllis is actively managing her public image in a seemingly casual situation. That her departure requires explanation indicates a norm at work. Her explanation is aimed at satisfying norms, not at truth. It might be true, but that's not why she said it.

The American way, that everybody constantly monitors everybody else and infers what their behavior might mean, is far from universal. In fact, many cultures do precisely the opposite, building barriers to prevent behavior from accidentally meaning something. An extreme example is the Yomut Turkmen. A bride, after moving into her husband's household but before the birth of her first child, wears a thick veil that prevents her from seeing and needs someone to guide her. Among the Buryat Mongols, a bride must maintain a “‘calm, almost blank demeanor. She was not allowed to raise her head, to laugh, to cry, to sing without being asked, to grind her teeth, or make any noise when eating. … A range of prohibitions prevented any expression of her sexuality, especially when in the presence of her father-in-law. Thus, she was required to always wear a hat in his presence, do up all her buttons, pull down her sleeves over her wrists, and the father-in-law in turn was expected to ignore her. Any instructions he might issue were transmitted as commands through the mother-in-law. … [She] must avoid pronouncing the name (or title, e.g., “horse-herdsman”) of any of her senior male affines and so, given that such names are frequently homophonous with ordinary, commonplace words, must make frequent circumlocutions and substitutions that cause her talk to sound avoidance-inflected.’” (Is it just me, or do these rules seem intended to prevent Mongol fathers-in-law from raping their daughters-in-law?) These restrictions are so pervasive and laborious that they effectively constitute a bride's participation in household life, though their spirit is very much the opposite of American display.

The chapter closes with the unsupported assertion that mediated participation–whether the medium is clay tablets or TikTok–builds on the same “fundamental architecture” as face-to-face participation. I am skeptical. As America plunges into a crisis of alienation, suspiciously synchronized with lockdowns and widespread social media adoption, examining how the sense of participation or alienation varies with the medium seems urgent and essential.

## 200 OK

In 421 BC, Sophocles introduced to Athens the worship of the renowned healer god Asklepios. The previous healer god, Amynos, had conspicuously failed to cure the ongoing pestilence. This is much the same strategy as firing the general when you are losing a war for technological reasons, or electing a different prime minister when the economy is bad. If you can't actually affect the outcome, better to publicly take some dramatic action. You are in power only if everybody acts as if you're in power only if you act as if you're powerful.

Asklepios receives worshippers. The snake and the staff complete the healer's look.

Inferring what others act as though they believe: you might think it's a bug in human inference, a quick heuristic used for social learning. You know better than to rely on heuristics. You read Richard Dawkins. You compute prior probabilities. You use System II, and see through the political tricks that fool the sheeple. Right?

Probably not, if you are able to hold a basic conversation.

“‘Here, when Dick asks, “How are you?” (in line 4) Deb’s response, “I’m fine,” is not a mere automatic, conditioned response. It displays a detailed understanding of Dick’s turn. First, by starting to talk at this moment (and not earlier), Deb’s talk at line 5 shows an understanding that Dick’s turn in line 4 was likely finished. Second, by saying “I’m fine”— which here constitutes an answer to Dick’s question— Deb demonstrates that she heard the previous turn to be a question. Third, by answering with a description of her personal state, Deb shows that she understands the kind of question it was (i.e., a content question rather than a yes-no question…). And fourth, by responding with fine rather than terrible or fantastic, Deb shows an understanding of what this question is doing in this environment, that is, that it is a routine opening inquiry, not to be taken literally.”’

Deb does not explicitly say “200 OK” like web servers or “copy” like radio operators in movies. Her speech act demonstrates what she understood, conveying a great deal beyond the explicit content. When conversants understand each other, all the necessary acknowledgement needed to confirm shared understanding is implied by the conversation continuing as expected.

Linguists can spend 50 years analyzing a single barbeque that happened in the 70s. Do normal people actually infer all of that from  “I’m fine”?

(The authors don't mention this, but unexpected statements trigger a strong EEG spike within a few hundred milliseconds, while expected statements generate comparatively little electrical activity. There are physical correlates for Consequences’ proposed expectations.)

Let's look at cases where expectations weren't met, and see how people react.

Roger produces something other than an answer, then is silent, then gives a wrong answer. Each time, Mother recognizes that Roger isn't on the same page and makes some attempt to repair the confusion. Her attempts are each based on a theory that potentially explains Roger's confusion: first she repeats, since he may not have heard, then she tries a simpler task, presuming that the first task was too hard.

In this fragment, Betty has to interrupt herself and quickly counter Ann's proposal to have a bite. If Betty just continued, not commenting on the meal invitation, then her continuation of the conversation would imply acquiescence. She has to clarify a second time when Ann takes her literally.

“‘Two children are playing with blocks. When the structure falls, one child screams, leading the supervising adult to complain, “Guys, too loud.” This occasions an excuse from the child, who assigns responsibility to the other by saying “She poked it.” The other child counters with “I tapped it.” ’” In this fragment, observe that “poked” implies blameworthiness, which even (especially?) children are sensitive to.

“‘A grandmother calls out to her grandchild, “Careful! Don’t run!” and the grandchild responds with “I’m not running, I’m jogging!” ’” Preemptive management of potential blame, completely implicit, much the same as above.

In the rest of science, we assume that the same principles apply everywhere until proven otherwise. The same should apply in linguistics. Once we have observed that basic conversation requires us to infer others’ mental states from their actions, and that this is utterly automatic and unconscious, we should assume the same operation goes on everywhere, from children's blocks to great power competition.

## Building Language out of Intersubjectivity

Many animals display the intersubjectivity we have discussed so far. You have doubtless seen it in interaction with pets. Human language, though, has words composed of sounds, allowing for unlimited vocabulary, “‘generative grammar (in which meaningful signs are combinable in patterns that are themselves meaningful),’” and metalanguage. The authors are extremely confident that these characteristics are unique to human language. I am ambivalent, having been repeatedly impressed by cognitive and communicative capabilities of protists, plants, tissue cultures, insect colonies, and fungal root networks. Really, every living thing seems to be way cooler and more capable than anyone realized, and their myriad communication channels are scantly documented compared to our own, so of course they look mute and dumb to us.

(You can skip this paragraph if you don't speak bio. Does plasmid exchange satisfy the three unique properties proposed by Consequences? Gene regulatory networks can certainly produce a combinatorial explosion of possible cell behavior (grammar). Semantics could be compared to gene => protein mapping, or possibly base => amino acid mapping. DNA is certainly self-referential, with organismic stress activating transposons. I'm not strongly arguing that plasmid exchange counts as language, just that something immediately comes to mind as a plausible candidate without doing any research.)

There's a lot of very weird understudied life forms and the authors are over-confident. Having noted this objection, I will continue the rest of this review as if human language is definitely unique, so that I can concisely summarize their arguments without reiterating my objection each time.

Consequences gives a very elegant illustration of shared intersubjective reference, of which metalinguistic self-reference is a special case.

“‘In the first frame, Viv (in the foreground) is telling Baga (in the background) about a man she thinks he might know but whose name he does not recognize. When the description given allows Baga to identify the person Viv is talking about, he points up the hill to his right (second frame). Notice that when Baga initially points, his own gaze is directed to the place he is indicating with his finger. … In the third frame, he maintains the pointing gesture but now gazes toward Viv, apparently to check whether his reference has been successful— checking, that is, on his recipient’s focus of attention. … He finds Viv pointing to the same place and the two engage in a moment of mutual gaze (last frame).’”

So then, how did protohumans get from gestures to language? Consequences thinks the first word may have been “Huh?”, which “‘is found in every known language.’” Imagine one protohuman is beckoning to another. Instead of coming closer, the second protohuman says “Huh?” “‘The interjection is metacommunicative insofar as it is about the communicative action just made by another agent. This is the wedge that introduces metalanguage into a not-yet-linguistic system. Then imagine that this response promotes the redoing of the gesture. In turn, the link between the interjection of puzzlement and the redoing of the not-yet-understood gesture becomes ritualized and so may be used again to achieve the same end— a repetition of the previous communicative move— either by this protohuman or by another who happened to witness the events unfold. We can imagine here a shift from learning via ontogenetic ritualization to imitation, that is, conventional transmission, the beating heart of language and culture. Would this constitute language? No, but it would explain how you can have metalanguage prior to the establishment of language as we know it.

This leads to the other of the two component puzzles: how system-like relations can arise from such item-based beginnings. … The key is to understand that once a slot is established for an expected action in a recurrent communicative sequence, alternatives to that action— as long as they occur in the same slot— derive meaning purely from the fact that they are alternatives to a known or expected point of reference. … In this way, once a protoword like Huh? was established, it created a slot into which other interjections might meaningfully occur. … “uhhuh” [is] an alternative to the initiation of repair. … So, we can imagine that once Huh? was established, an opposing form could easily occur in that slot, indicating the “antithesis” of Huh?— that is, conveying the meaning that the prior move has been understood and that compliance is to follow. This sort of simple paradigm of opposed, minimally semantic forms would constitute a basis for language. This basis is not in the logical concepts of reference and predication or in the individual cognitive capacity to represent events and situations. Instead, it emerges from … move-by-move accountable interaction, of the kind illustrated, for example, by the two men sawing timber in chapter 1. A simple paradigm of responsive interjections might thus serve as initial steps toward grammar (see Hurford 2012 for an account of the evolution of grammar beginning with interjections). Subject to laws of semiotic conventionalization, over time these interjections would take on more semantic nuance and content. And these forms would provide jumping-off points for expansions in the form of additional slots and paradigms, kicking off open-ended processes of grammaticalization that underpin the complex grammatical systems seen in the world’s languages today.’”

What happened at the moment of apotheosis, when the up-and-to-the-right trajectory of human civilization began? Was it like in 2001, where mysterious monoliths endowed our prefrontal cortices with the divine spark of consciousness? No, it was just one confused ape who said “huh?”, and then BOOM! there was self-reference and grammar and our glorious destiny began to unfold.

Such elaboration of grammar and vocabulary from humble beginnings plays out as children are learning to speak. They start with interjections, such as “no!”, and build up to phrases that are purely social, such as “Look, mom!” or “I'm a fire truck”, rather than material references: “I would like you to change my diaper,” or “What are the properties of bicycles?” If children want to accomplish something in the material world, they can just cry, no language needed.

(“Where are you going?” “To pick up the human infants from daycare.”)

When children show objects to adults, or point at them, adults commonly name the indicated object: “That's your Lego!” You would be forgiven for thinking that kids are trying to learn the names of concrete objects before moving to more abstract concepts. The authors have a different interpretation: children are establishing a shared reference with the adult, much as Viv and Baga established a shared reference a few paragraphs ago. The child is equally satisfied if the adult doesn't name the object, perhaps saying “Wow, that's great!” Any acknowledgement will suffice.

The common academic idea of language is that basic words are those referring to a concrete object or action: “run”, “bicycle”. Metalanguage is supposed to be more abstract and therefore later in development. This proposed hierarchy of abstraction layers has philosophical roots, since in this view the main purpose of language is to refer to the physical world.

As Consequences proposes that metalanguage developed first, this would also invert the purpose of language. Instead of speaking to coordinate physical action, we act in order to maintain our shared understandings.

“‘Perhaps the most important feature of interaction sequencing in humans is that the structures it produces are accountable. If a recipient does not produce the conditionally relevant next action, this is an accountable fact, and people orient to it. Recipients may account for not responding (e.g., by indicating that their reason for not answering is that they do not know) and first-speakers may pursue such accounts if they are not offered. Another aspect of the accountability involved in interaction sequencing is seen in reports and complaints about third-party failures (e.g., “He didn’t answer me”). Such reports radically transform the nature of human social life: “Humans alone among the social vertebrates can know one another substantially by repute.” … Reputation has untold consequences for human sociality. … Other apes, not having available to them a flexible semiotic code like a human language, are accountable in the domain of brute forces, not social norms.’”

I previously offered Ethereum as an analogy for this. Recall that when a computer would like to participate in ethereal record-keeping, it must first place a deposit. If the majority of other computers compare notes amongst themselves and find it fraudulent or erroneous, then that computer will lose its deposit. That computer will need to find enough Ether for another deposit before it can participate again. In this way, the blockchain can enforce norms for the behavior of its constituent computers, with no capacity for physical reward and punishment. The amount of Ethereum credit held by a computer is analogous to a human's reputation and credibility. There is even an etymological connection: credit and credibility both from Latin credo, belief. “Soft power” is when humans enforce norms with no capacity for physical reward and punishment. Ethereum nodes explicitly repeat and confirm data stored on the blockchain. Humans implicitly act out and infer intersubjective common knowledge. Humans implicitly constitute a distributed ledger.

We sometimes say things that are references to the material world or act for material benefit. Science and engineering, in fewer words. Rationalism claims these occasions are the default, that purely social acts, which are false or vacuous from the materialist perspective, are reasoning errors made by people who are essentially trying to do science and engineering but aren't very good at it. I claim the opposite. Moments of science and engineering, though they certainly exist and can be beneficial, are the exceptions. By default, we act and speak to imply updates to the ledger, usually to the benefit of our own account.

## Out of the Dark

Darwin's vision of man as the hairless ape was bad enough, but now the authors cast us as the political ape, spewing self-serving half-truths while beauty, truth and goodness seem hollow displays. What positive goal can one work towards that isn't fake?

“Science! Progress!” answer the rationalists. “Granted, maybe much of what we say is vacuous social grease. Why worry about it so much? A bit of emotional intelligence can keep impactful research organizations running smoothly.”

You should worry about it more. Suppose a westerner loses a loved one. Their grief can be a huge drag for months on end. They can't choose to stop it. Their cultural conditioning determines which choices are even possible; grief seems obviously natural and necessary. So much talk of deconstructing norms has done nothing to change this. Months of grief is way more impactful for them then the stuff they're conditioned to choose, which brand of cereal or whatever. It gets worse: so many people spend their entire lives pursuing retirement funds, career or family, not even realizing that there are more than three options. Optimizing only those decisions visible to us reminds me of that well-worn but apt story of the drunk searching for his keys under the streetlamp where he can see, not where the keys probably are. The most impactful changes we could make are things we don't even realize are possible to change. It seems an intractable paradox.

Instead of solving the paradox in abstract, let's work through a concrete example and generalize at the end. Imagine Jack says “I'M NOT ANGRY!!” The materialist approach is to assume that “anger” summarizes the physiological state of the brain; for the sake of argument, let's say it indexes the concentration of adrenaline. If you wanted to know whether Jack's statement was true, you would measure his adrenaline concentration and compare it to some threshold. If it's too high, he must have somehow bungled his introspection. Perhaps the adrenaline itself was interfering!

The intersubjective approach, though, is not to ask whether the statement is materially true, but to ask whether Jack is even trying to perform introspection. The form of his statement is a denial, and social norms deplete the credibility of angry people. Certainly he's incentivized to deny his anger. Correspondingly, if he actually introspects, the results will probably not be flattering, and he'll probably lose whatever argument he's in the middle of. Jack most likely just denied the accusation without even attempting introspection; both the form of the statement and his incentives support this. This is not dishonesty in the sense of consciously lying, but more a lack of integrity: merely the implicit threat of losing credibility was enough for him not to introspect. A good metaphor is the corrupt night watchman, who makes sure to never see the smugglers. Instead of evaluating the material basis for a claim, we can evaluate the integrity of its goals.

Believing our own bullshit comes from maximizing our own reputation; how we think others see us; our self-image. Integrity comes from weakening our soft power incentives. Optimizing our self-image is a habit, and we can change it through stubborn practice. I suggest volunteering for a cause, any cause. Work is a social construct; if you're really choosing autonomously you won't compulsively avoid work. Money is a social construct; if you're really choosing autonomously you won't compulsively envy those who out-earn you. Most important of all, if you really chose a worthwhile cause, then you'll derive your self-worth from your contribution to it, and not from what you imagine others think of you, and then you'll be less thrall to others’ desire.

## The Part Where I Actually Review the Book

[Consequences of Language: From Primary to Enhanced Intersubjectivity](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5499/Consequences-of-LanguageFrom-Primary-to-Enhanced)by N. J. Enfield and Jack Sidnell ([open-access PDF](http://direct.mit.edu/books/book-pdf/2231213/book_9780262372749.pdf)) is great! You should read it.

Wait, you wanted insightful criticism? Well, OK…

Their account of intersubjectivity is true but incomplete. As a non-expert, I can easily think of things besides action and accountability that produce intersubjectivity. Probably someone who put in more effort could find more holes.

Starting in 1947, the De Beers diamond cartel ran a series of ads which created the tradition of diamond engagement rings, and so clearly modified the intersubjective ledger.

If you were very creative, you might be able to wring action or accountability from some element of this ad. A better approach, though, is to acknowledge what is by far the most salient element: fantasy. The painting, “Lover's Dream”, has a surreal feel. The woman's figure is elongated, like an Etruscan statue or a El Greco painting[4]. The rose and diamond are weirdly large, the mountains are conical, and she modeled for the portraitist during an eclipse. The next largest element is the slogan, seemingly calligraphed with a brush in cursive, which portrays neither action nor accountability. Third largest is a sort-of poem, which reads “

the mysteries of love[:] Love has a language all its own, sweet and full of secret meanings for each lover's heart. It speaks in the mountains and the sun, in buds, and in the wondrous light of an engagement diamond. And while its voice may someday fade from the mountains, sun and buds, it lingers clarion clear in the diamond's joyful flames, repeating the dreams of lovers down their married lifetime and beyond.

”

Technical information about the prices of diamonds is, literally, marginalized [4.5]. The ad puts most of its space towards romanticizing romance. And it worked to update the intersubjective ledger. This ad reminds me of everything that's missing from Consequences’ account of intersubjectivity. What happened to art and music and poetry? Where did the authors misplace revolutionary speeches and tear-jerker journalism? All these things create shared understanding and change our behavior, but without accountability. The first couple to buy diamond engagement rings necessarily did so without the fear that others might censure them for not buying. In fact, they might have hoped for others to notice and comment on their glittering rings. Wait a second, doesn't it happen all the time that people perform social acts to attract attention and commentary? In the authors’ account, fulfilled norms pass without comment, and if someone calls out what you are doing it is to censure you. They would make good monks, performing the well-established normal routine in near silence and only commenting to correct errors. But that's not what the rest of society focuses on!

One strand of intellectual history woven into Consequences is the “tyranny of accountability”, which was likely inspired by Foucault's study of the army, mental institutions, and prisons. Cheery stuff, right? His choice of case studies led to a bleak view of social roles as driven by power relations, with the strong exploiting the weak. Given the grim locations Foucault chose for his earliest work, the dark outlook he developed may not generalize well. Yet Consequences inherits this approach and portrays accountability as a tyrannical force, even in the relatively harmless day-to-day conversations that concern the authors. We probably have a lot of social motivations besides fear of censure that drive intersubjectivity. Consequences misses them. This omission matters: Foucault deconstructs the ideology of the powerful and ends up viewing every smallest interaction as oppressive. I'm proposing to deconstruct what misguides your own actions and view every smallest interaction as a chance to be a better person.

Intersubjectivity flows through many media, from Venus figures and bone flutes to provocative missile tests and the global financial system. The authors’ choice to focus on conversations and do one thing thoroughly is understandable. I feel, though, that afterwards they step back and say “Ta-da! We explained shared understanding.” I wish they had gestured at what is missing from their focus. They gestured at learning by imitation in their conclusion, briefly hinting how it might fit into their framework. I miss the same thing for fantasy, (embodied by stories and ads), physical tokens of shared understanding (statues, pyramids, money, weapons…) and probably more I haven't thought of.

All that said, I chose Consequences for this audience because of its precise and technical treatment of a narrow subject. Other texts on intersubjectivity tend to be quite wide-ranging, and would probably alienate you guys.

Special relativity was incomplete but nonetheless praiseworthy. Identifying action and accountability as major components of intersubjectivity was a worthwhile step.

the mysteries of intersubjectivity, which has a language all its own, sweet and full of secret meanings for each human's heart. It speaks in sawing and weaving, in ads, and in the wondrous light of an engagement diamond. And while its voice may someday fade from the sawing, weaving, and ads, it lingers clarion clear in useless objects: diamonds; pyramids; cathedrals; Bezos’ giant underground clock; proclaiming the glory of your ideology down your civilizational lifetime and beyond.

## Further Reading

*   Nick Enfield has a [solo book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Language_vs_Reality/PKzIEAAAQBAJ?hl=en) which I haven't read but seems less academic and more philosophical. He was [interviewed](https://braininspired.co/podcast/166/) about it on the Brain Inspired podcast.
*   MIT publishes a [ton](https://direct.mit.edu/books/search-results?fl_SiteID=5&f_ContentType=Book&access_openaccess=true) of open access books. I like browsing them, because it's an essentially friendly experience, like spending the day in a bookshop and reading as much of each book as I want before deciding. No paywalls, ads, or newsletters, so I don't have to be on the defensive.
*   At the beginning of this review, when I railed against the poor writing of the galaxy-brains, I was mostly just describing the writing of Slavoj Žižek. The examples he uses to support his theories are so diverse that they give his books a surreal, dream-like feel. One of his books contains the sentence: “The space in which the (un)dead can talk without moral constraints, as imagined by Dostoevsky, prefigures this Gnostic-cyberspace dream.” [5] Of the handful of his books that I've read, the most compatible with ACX readers is [The Sublime Object of Ideology](https://archive.org/details/sublimeobjectofi0000ieks). It's his first book, and it's written quite differently. Here, he precisely defines new jargon, then uses his previously defined concepts later to build up a tower of abstractions. I was constantly using Ctrl-F to find where terms were defined. It felt like I was reading an abstract algebra textbook, or like I was manually linking and compiling a C++ program. Sublime is hard to understand, but it's hard to understand in a way that might work for some of you, and if you take the time to reconstruct his tower of abstractions in your own mind, then you'll discover that it hangs together. As far as I know, this book is the closest we have to a textbook on intersubjectivity which covers everything I consider important.

Diagrams I made to understand the last chapter of Sublime illustrate that it's difficult but possible to link together all the concepts. Don't bother deciphering my notes; decipher the book instead.

*   [Modernity and Self-Identity](https://archive.org/details/modernityselfide0000unse/page/n5/mode/1up) by Anthony Giddens predicted (in 1991) and explains the current identity crisis. Dense academic writing, don't let that put you off, the ideas themselves are pretty approachable.
*   I heard John Robb ([substack](https://johnrobb.substack.com/), [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/johnrobb)) on a podcast, and he said that maybe the progressive left could turn against Israel, and I said to myself “Who is this guy? He's crazy!” Then after Oct 7, when the progressive left started lobbing accusations at Israel, I went back to check out his stuff. He uses whatever works, including sometimes intersubjectivity, to make predictions and offer frameworks at the intersection of tech and war, dividing his attention roughly evenly between moral, psychological and physical war. I almost didn't include him on this list, because he never focuses on intersubjectivity per se, only bringing it up when it's useful. I included him anyway, because he does some things that persuade a curmudgeon:

*   Discussing intersubjectivity because it's actually useful for prediction and control, rather than as an academic interest
*   Producing falsifiable predictions [6]
*   Writing in a terse, bulleted format
*   Saying “protecting our communities” and other right-wing phrases, which could persuade someone who identifies intersubjectivity as a left partisan ideology
*   Offering actionable suggestions

## Takeaways

*   intersubjectivity = activity + accountability

*   Metaphysics is intersubjectivity misunderstood.
*   The social system matters not only for its outcomes, but its internal process is felt by the nodes.
*   Humans constitute a distributed ledger.

*   We act and speak to imply updates to the ledger.
*   We can, unconsciously, keep track of how others are likely to view us, and can formulate a strategy to optimize this.

*   We must choose, exclusively, between two definitions of truth: prediction and control vs material correspondence.

*   Instead of evaluating the material basis for a claim, we can evaluate the integrity of its goals.
*   Change minds by changing incentives.

*   Deconstruct what misguides your own actions and view every smallest interaction as a chance to be a better person.

*   Thick ethical concepts suck people into pointless, repetitive behavior.
*   Publicly display what you really believe in.
*   If you want to change your own mind, you should plug into different institutions.
*   Volunteer for a cause, any cause.

## Notes

[0]: I made no effort to check if this has been replicated.

[1]: The authors use “status” instead of “role”, following convention in linguistics. Writing for laypeople, I opt for “role”, following convention in everyday speech.

[2]: Technically, it is the humans who configure Ethereum staking pools who are not consciously lying, since staking pools are software and have no mental states.

[2.5]: More precisely, we're forced to choose between prediction/control and material correspondence as principles. In a concrete situation, you might face a spectrum of possible tradeoffs, but if you’re consciously making a tradeoff then you’ve sacrificed at least one of prediction/control and material correspondence as a principle you try always to follow.

[3]: I am reminded of the Strasbourg dancing plague, where people had been culturally informed that someone in their situation would become infected with contagious dancing, and then they involuntarily enacted this expectation. At western funerals, people have been culturally informed that someone in their situation would become uncontainably bereaved, and then they involuntarily enact this expectation.

[4]: or like a woman in a modern ad. Feminists keep complaining that women in ads are infeasibly skinny, but at least a few women actually are skinny. Women in ads have freakishly long fingers and limbs, especially their legs are disturbingly elongated, and hardly anyone notices, not even the feminists! Maybe it's part of a conspiracy by long-limbed aliens to replace us, and feminists are part of the cover-up. The ancient Etruscans knew this, and the layer of Roman ruins is a literal cover-up!

[4.5]: Among rationalists, a popular account for the public display of expensive useless objects is to credibly display wealth. This doesn't quite hang together. The ad mentions but downplays the cost of the diamonds. And diamonds were costly before these ads ran, so cost alone doesn't motivate people to buy diamonds. And of course, the tradition that De Beers created is of diamond engagement rings, not rings for rich people.

[5]: from “How to Read Lacan”

[6]: John Robb says stuff he thinks might happen and is really unlikely if you don't use his frameworks. Pulling numbers out of my ass, you could imagine the prior is 10%, he predicts something with 50% confidence and he's right about half the time. That gives real information gain. He could get rich as a VC by predicting startups that well.
